## Core Principles

### I. Peer-Led Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every program, service, or initiative MUST be developed with meaningful input from people with lived or living experience of drug use. Peer involvement is required at all stages: planning, design, implementation, and evaluation. No decisions about services should be made without consulting the people who will use them - embodying "Nothing About Us Without Us."

**Rationale**: NUAA's foundational principle ensures that programs remain relevant, accessible, and effective for the communities they serve.

### II. Evidence-Based Planning

All programs MUST be grounded in current research, best practices, and demonstrated needs within the community. Planning documents must reference supporting evidence, data sources, and alignment with harm reduction principles. Decisions should be traceable to evidence or clear rationale.

**Rationale**: Ensures resources are used effectively and programs have the best chance of achieving positive outcomes.

### III. Funding and Compliance Alignment

Every program MUST clearly identify funding sources, compliance requirements, and reporting obligations. Grant conditions, KPI targets, and funder expectations must be documented upfront and tracked throughout implementation. No program can proceed without clear funding pathway and compliance framework.

**Rationale**: Protects organizational sustainability and ensures grant obligations are met while maintaining program integrity.

### IV. Stakeholder Integration

Programs MUST identify and engage all relevant stakeholders including community members, partner organizations, government agencies, and funders. Stakeholder mapping, communication plans, and feedback mechanisms are required for all initiatives exceeding local scope.

**Rationale**: Complex health and social programs require coordinated approaches and multiple perspectives to succeed.

### V. Harm Reduction First

All programs MUST align with harm reduction principles and NUAA's mission to advance health, human rights, and dignity. Programs cannot promote abstinence-only approaches or stigmatizing practices. Evidence of harm reduction alignment must be documented in all planning materials.

**Rationale**: Maintains organizational integrity and ensures consistency with NUAA's core values and evidence-based approaches.

## Funding and Compliance Framework

Programs must identify and document:

- Primary and secondary funding sources
- Grant reporting requirements and deadlines
- KPI targets and measurement approaches
- Risk mitigation for funding dependencies
- Compliance obligations (regulatory, professional, organizational)
- Budget allocation and cost tracking mechanisms

## Stakeholder Engagement Standards

Required stakeholder categories:

- **Primary users**: People who use drugs, community members
- **Peer workers**: Current and potential peer workforce
- **Partner organizations**: Health services, community organizations, advocacy groups
- **Government**: Relevant agencies, policy makers, regulators
- **Funders**: Grant bodies, government departments, foundations
- **Internal**: NUAA staff, board, volunteers, members

## Quality Assurance Framework

Programs require evidence of:

- Community consultation and co-design processes
- Literature review and evidence base
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Evaluation framework and success metrics
- Resource allocation and sustainability planning
- Cultural safety and accessibility considerations

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other program planning practices at NUAA. All program proposals and plans must demonstrate compliance with these principles. Amendments require board approval and community consultation.

Programs violating constitutional principles must provide documented justification or redesign to achieve compliance. Complexity deviations from simplicity principles must demonstrate that simpler approaches were evaluated and found insufficient.

The constitution serves as a gate for resource allocation - programs cannot proceed to implementation without constitutional compliance review.
