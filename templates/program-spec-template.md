# Program Specification: [PROGRAM_NAME]

**Program ID**: `[###-program-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Program description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse program description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No program description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: target population, services, outcomes, stakeholders, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User/Community Scenarios & Evaluation section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine community impact scenarios"
5. Generate Program Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be measurable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Stakeholders and Funding Sources
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove operational details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT the community needs and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to operate (no staffing models, operational procedures, detailed budgets)
- üë• Written for board members, funders, and community stakeholders, not operational staff

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every program
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the program
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a program prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "peer support program" without target demographics), mark it
3. **Think like an evaluator**: Every vague requirement should fail the "measurable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Target population and eligibility criteria
   - Geographic scope and service boundaries
   - Outcome measures and success indicators
   - Funding sources and sustainability
   - Partner organization roles and responsibilities
   - Cultural safety and accessibility requirements

## Community Impact & Evaluation _(mandatory)_

### Primary Community Story

[Describe the main community journey and program interaction in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** [community need/situation], **When** [program intervention], **Then** [expected community outcome]
2. **Given** [participant situation], **When** [service delivery], **Then** [expected participant outcome]

### Edge Cases

- What happens when [boundary condition, e.g., participant in crisis]?
- How does program handle [challenging scenario, e.g., funding cuts, staff shortages]?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Program MUST [specific service capability, e.g., "provide sterile injecting equipment"]
- **FR-002**: Program MUST [specific capability, e.g., "maintain confidential participant records"]
- **FR-003**: Participants MUST be able to [key access/interaction, e.g., "access services without identification"]
- **FR-004**: Program MUST [data/information requirement, e.g., "collect de-identified outcome data"]
- **FR-005**: Program MUST [compliance requirement, e.g., "meet NSW Health NSP guidelines"]

_Example of marking unclear requirements:_

- **FR-006**: Program MUST serve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target population not specified - general community, specific demographics, geographic boundaries?]
- **FR-007**: Program MUST operate [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: operating hours/schedule not specified]

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Program MUST be accessible to [target population] within [timeframe]
- **NFR-002**: Program MUST maintain [quality standard, e.g., "peer worker ratios per guidelines"]
- **NFR-003**: Program MUST achieve [outcome measure, e.g., "80% participant satisfaction"]
- **NFR-004**: Program MUST comply with [regulatory framework]

## Stakeholder Mapping _(mandatory)_

### Primary Stakeholders

- **Community Members**: [specific demographics/groups served]
- **Peer Workers**: [roles and involvement level]
- **Partner Organizations**: [specific partners and their roles]

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Government Agencies**: [specific departments/programs]
- **Funders**: [specific funding bodies/grants]
- **NUAA Internal**: [relevant teams/departments]

### Stakeholder Engagement Requirements

- How will each stakeholder group be consulted during design?
- What ongoing feedback mechanisms are required?
- Who has decision-making authority at different stages?

## Funding and Compliance _(mandatory)_

### Funding Sources

- **Primary**: [specific funding program/grant, amount if known]
- **Secondary**: [backup or supplementary funding]
- **Sustainability**: [long-term funding strategy]

### Compliance Requirements

- **Regulatory**: [specific regulations, licensing requirements]
- **Funder**: [grant conditions, reporting requirements]
- **Organizational**: [NUAA policies, board requirements]
- **Professional**: [relevant professional standards]

### Key Performance Indicators

- [Specific, measurable KPIs required by funders]
- [Additional NUAA organizational KPIs]
- [Community outcome measures]

## Risk Assessment _(if high-risk program)_

### Identified Risks

- [Major risks to program success, sustainability, or safety]
- [Funding/political risks]
- [Operational risks]

### Mitigation Strategies

- [How each major risk will be addressed]

## Cultural Safety & Accessibility _(mandatory)_

### Cultural Safety Requirements

- How will the program ensure cultural safety for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members?
- What specific cultural competency requirements exist?

### Accessibility Requirements

- Physical accessibility needs
- Communication accessibility (languages, formats)
- Economic accessibility (free services, transport, etc.)
- Social accessibility (non-judgmental, peer-led approach)

## Evidence Base _(mandatory)_

### Supporting Research

- [Key research supporting this program approach]
- [Evidence for target population need]
- [Evidence for proposed intervention effectiveness]

### Best Practice Examples

- [Similar programs with demonstrated success]
- [Lessons learned from comparable initiatives]
