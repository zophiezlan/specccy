# NUAA Program Planning Framework

A comprehensive toolkit for implementing Program-Driven Development (PDD) for NSW Users and AIDS Association initiatives

The NUAA Program Planning Framework is an adapted version of the Spec-Driven Development toolkit, specifically tailored for planning, tracking, and implementing NUAA programs, services, and initiatives. This framework ensures that all programs align with NUAA's constitutional principles while maintaining focus on community needs, peer leadership, and harm reduction approaches.

## 🌟 Overview

This framework supports the planning and implementation of NUAA's diverse programs including:

- **Needle and Syringe Programs (NSP)** - Peer-led distribution and primary health services
- **PeerLine** - Confidential peer support telephone service
- **DanceWize NSW** - Harm reduction at festivals and events
- **ConnectED** - Peer worker training and professional development
- **Outreach Programs** - Regional and rural service delivery
- **Advocacy Initiatives** - Policy and community mobilization campaigns

## 🏗️ Framework Philosophy

### Constitutional Principles

Every NUAA program must align with five core constitutional principles:

1. **Peer-Led Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** - Meaningful involvement of people with lived experience at all stages
2. **Evidence-Based Planning** - Grounded in research, best practices, and demonstrated community needs
3. **Funding and Compliance Alignment** - Clear funding pathways and compliance frameworks
4. **Stakeholder Integration** - Comprehensive engagement with community, partners, and funders
5. **Harm Reduction First** - Alignment with harm reduction principles and NUAA's mission

### Program-Driven Development Workflow

```text
📋 SPECIFY → 📐 PLAN → 🔄 ACTIVITIES → 🚀 IMPLEMENT → 📊 EVALUATE
```

1. **SPECIFY**: Define community needs and program requirements
2. **PLAN**: Develop service delivery model and stakeholder engagement strategy
3. **ACTIVITIES**: Break down implementation into concrete actionable steps
4. **IMPLEMENT**: Execute activities while maintaining constitutional compliance
5. **EVALUATE**: Measure outcomes and iterate for continuous improvement
